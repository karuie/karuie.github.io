Hi, I am Yimin Yan, a data scientist in machine learning for quant finance. 

I did my master degree at University of Southampton with [Jason Hilton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/5xgnrc/doctor-jason-hilton) on Data Analytics. I am currently a risk investment data analyst at St. James's Place. Previously, I worked as a data analyst at Stable, collaborating with [Ethan Soh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethansohyi) as a developer. 

I am a street dancer, a mother of two rabbits, and a traveler around the world.
