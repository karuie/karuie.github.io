Hi, I am Yimin Yan and I have a keen interest in creating statistical and machine learning algorithms within the field of quantitative finance.

In my current position, I serve as an Investment Risk Analyst at [St. James's Place](https://www.sjp.co.uk/). I completed my master's degree at the University of Southampton alongside [Jason Hilton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/5xgnrc/doctor-jason-hilton).

Outside of my professional endeavors, I enjoy street dancing, caring for my two rabbits, and exploring various destinations around the globe as a passionate traveler.

Please feel free to reach out to me via email: [Yimin Yan](mailto:yimin23y@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub]%20Hello%20Yimin%20)
