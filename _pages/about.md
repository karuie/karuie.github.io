Hi, I am Yimin Yan, a data scientist in machine learning for finance. 

I did my master degree at University of Southampton with [Jason Hilton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/5xgnrc/doctor-jason-hilton) on Data Analytics. I am currently data analyst at Stable. I work on machine learning for financial data. 

I am a street dancer, a mother of two rabbits, and a traveler around the world.
